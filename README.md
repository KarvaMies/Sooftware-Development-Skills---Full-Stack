# Software development skills - Fullstack project running guide
## by Jeremias Moberg

The project is functionally the same as the coursework, but the 'dashboard'
component was changed to 'tasks' component and functions as todo list.

User can add tasks to the list, mark them as completed, undo the completion,
and finally, delete tasks from the list. The tasks are saved to the database
and users have links to their tasks in their user model.

## Usage
1. Download the project
2. Open terminal
3. Go to 'Project/' folder
4. Type 'npm start' and hit enter
5. Open your browser and go to 'http://localhost:3000'
